Upon launching the application, you will be greeted by text boxes in which you can input your groceries!
You can make an item by inputting a name, color, price and description. You must also give it a category. If the category is not listed, you can make the category and then create your item. If you do want your item(s) on the list anymore, you can simply delete them.
